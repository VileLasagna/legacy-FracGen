# legacy-FracGen

Legacy school maths project

It was later hijacked and used to get my first grips with C++11's new
futures and promises API. A simple project that can show multitasking in
action pretty easily being implemented in a very simple way

## Benchmarking

For funzies I've made this into a benchmarking tool, alebit an extremely

graphical output due to switching that out being more work than it's worth
given the scope of this "toy benchmark")
